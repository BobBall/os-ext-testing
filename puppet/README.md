# OpenStack External Test Platform Puppet Module

This directory contains some puppet modules and Bash scripts
that can be used to set up and maintain an external testing
platform that can be linked to the upstream OpenStack CI platform.

It installs Jenkins, Jenkins Job Builder (JJB), the Gerrit
Jenkins plugin, and a set of scripts that make running a variety
of OpenStack integration tests easy.

## Pre-requisites

1) You will need to register a Gerrit account with the upstream OpenStack
CI platform. You can read the instructions for doing
[that](http://ci.openstack.org/third_party.html#requesting-a-service-account)

2) You will need to have the `wget`, `openssl`, `ssl-cert` and `ca-certificates`
packages installed on your host or VM before running anything in this
repository.

3) You will want to create a Git repository containing the data files -- such as the
Gerrit username and private SSH key file for your testing account -- that are used
in setting up the test platform.

## Usage

### Setting up the Jenkins Master

On the machine you will use as your Jenkins master, run:

```
wget https://raw.github.com/jaypipes/os-ext-testing/master/puppet/install_master.sh
bash install_master.sh
```

The script will install Puppet, create an SSH key for the Jenkins master, create
self-signed certificates for Apache, and then will ask you for the URL of the Git
repository you are using as your data repository (see Prerequisites #3 above). Enter
the URL of your data repository and hit Enter.

Puppet will proceed to set up the Jenkins master.

### Setting up Jenkins Slaves

On each machine you will use as a Jenkins slave, run:

```
wget https://raw.github.com/jaypipes/os-ext-testing/slave/puppet/install_slave.sh
bash install_slave.sh
```

The script will install Puppet, create an SSH key for the Jenkins slave, and then
Puppet will install the Jenkins slave.
